    ;The  memmove()  function  copies n bytes from memory area src to memory
    ;   area dest.  The memory areas may overlap: copying takes place as though
    ;   the  bytes in src are first copied into a temporary array that does not
    ;   overlap src or dest, and the bytes are then copied from  the  temporary
    ;   array to dest.
    ;The memmove() function returns a pointer to dest.
